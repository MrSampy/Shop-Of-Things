## Difficulties, I have faced
- I couldn't add authorization and authentication for a long time because all the manuals I read didn't mention the code, which was an important part of my system. </br>
Startup.cs
```c#
 services.AddAuthorization(options =>
            {
                var defaultAuthorizationPolicyBuilder = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder(
                    JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

                defaultAuthorizationPolicyBuilder =
                    defaultAuthorizationPolicyBuilder.RequireAuthenticatedUser();

                options.DefaultPolicy = defaultAuthorizationPolicyBuilder.Build();
            });
```
 - I had some bugs with mapping entities. It was due to function .ReverseMap(). Now I understand, that it will be better to write ways of mapping for every case separately.
 - During testing of Data layer, I face with the problem of tracking of entities. So, the problem was solved by rewriting Update methods.

## Future
1. Add FrontEnd part.
2. Add more unique features.
